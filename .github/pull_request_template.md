<!-- Thank you for making a pull request! -->

<!-- jest-pact is built and maintained by developers like you, and we appreciate contributions very much. You are awesome! -->

<!-- Our changelog is automatically built from our commit history, using conventional changelog. This means we'd like to take care that: -->

<!-- - commit messages with the prefix `fix:` or `fix(foo):` are suitable to be added to the changelog under "Fixes and improvements" -->
<!-- - commit messages with the prefix `feat:` or `feat(foo):` are suitable to be added to the changelog under "New features" -->

<!-- If you've made many commits that don't adhere to this style, we recommend squashing
your commits to a new branch before making a PR. Alternatively, we can do a squash
merge, but you'll lose attribution for your change. -->

<!-- For more information please see CONTRIBUTING.md -->
